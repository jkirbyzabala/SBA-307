# SBA-307
I created a vacation planner website that meets the requirements outlined for my Skills Based Assessment (SBA). The HTML and CSS Requirements are listed below. I have also commented the requirements in both the HTML and CSS files.

Note:

I used the same css file (stylesP2andP3) for both IndexP2.html and IndexP3.html, which are my Login and Question Submission files respectively. 
I used Coolers to find the color palette
Three Pages:

index.html This is my main page
indexP2.html Login Page
indexP3.html This is a page where someone can submit a question

Ten different HTML tags:
<title>
<link>
<script>
<style>
<body>
<ul>
<li>
<a>
<div>
<h1>, <h2>
<hr>
<fieldset>, <legend>
<input>
<select>, <option>
<table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tr>, <th>, <td>
<br>

Total 20


One Table:

Locations List Table starts at row 108
